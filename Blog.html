<h2 style="color:White;">I started my journey in January 2019 in a football tournament when my school team need a photographer. After that tournament, I realized that Iâ€™m a good photographer. After that, I started developing my talent and participating in events, carnivals and many more places. Added to that, I was also taking pictures in family and friends gatherings. In February 2021 i created an instagram account and started posting my pictures there. Later on, Bahrain international circuit contacted me and i became a photographer there.
